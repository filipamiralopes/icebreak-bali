        Cold exposure causes
        <br /> the release of dopamine
      </h4>
      <p>
        Dopamine is a powerful molecule
        <br /> capable of elevating mood, enhancing
        <br /> focus, attention and goal-directed
        <br /> behavior. Even short bouts of cold
        <br /> exposure can cause a lasting increase
        <br /> in dopamine and sustained elevation
        <br /> of mood, energy, and focus.
