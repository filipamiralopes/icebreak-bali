            Red light therapy enhances the function of mitochondria, boosting energy production in cells. 
            This increase in cellular energy supports healing, reduces inflammation, and can improve skin health. 
            Even short sessions of red light exposure can lead to long-lasting benefits, such as improved recovery, 
            reduced pain, and enhanced feelings of vitality and wellbeing.
