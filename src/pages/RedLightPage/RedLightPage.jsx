        Red light stimulates
        <br /> energy production
        <br /> in cells
      </h4>
      <p>
        Red light therapy enhances the function
        <br /> of mitochondria, boosting energy production
        <br /> in cells. This increase in cellular energy
        <br /> supports healing, reduces inflammation,
        <br /> and can improve skin health. Even short
        <br /> sessions of red light exposure can lead to
        <br /> long-lasting benefits, such as improved
        <br /> recovery, reduced pain, and enhanced
        <br /> feelings of vitality and wellbeing.
